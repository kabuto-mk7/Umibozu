## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzcyMjc3MDAucG5n/original/wzaFfm.png)

This is a C# game project I worked on during the Christmas period of 2021, I made this game for fun, to develop my skills with C# and Unity and to dip my toes into 3D game development. The result is this PlayStation 1 esque horror game similar to Silent Hill or Resident Evil.

What I learned from this project:

* Making use of Unity and game engines
* Developing my skills with C#
* Graphics design elements, 3D modelling
* Working with full stack, from design and front end to back end
* Using API's 
* Learning Object Oriented programming techniques
* Learning optimization techniques for gameplay


## Built With

Here are the main frameworks and tools I used

* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
